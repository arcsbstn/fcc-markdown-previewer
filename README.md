# Markdown Previewer

View the project [here](https://epic-ramanujan-65ff54.netlify.app/).

My solution for the [Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) project under [freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/). 

This solution uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap5 for the basic structure and styling. It also uses React and Marked to parse the markdown input and render an HTML preview.
